            <h2>Inventory Warehousing & Storage</h2>
            <p>
                You can expand and contract as your inventory needs change. Inventory is managed in our centrally located state-of-the-art distribution center in the geographic center of the United States. We use a proprietary Warehouse Management System (WMS) that enables us to measure and audit inbound and outbound activity. You are in complete control of your inventory at all times. Because each client is different, we designed our system to be highly flexible and scalable to accurately process high volume as well as low volume shipments.

            <h2>Order Receipt & Processing</h2>
            <p>
               There is no software to buy or install. Our system supports everything from manual order entry via our call center agents to fully integrated EDI. We can connect directly with your existing order management tools or build a complete shopping cart with credit card processing. You control the entire process and have on-demand 24/7 access to tracking information, order status and inventory levels.

            <h2>Pick, Pack, & Ship</h2>
            <p>
                As an extension of your team, our dedicated warehouse crew uses our radio frequency pick-train technology to maintain the highest degree of accuracy throughout the picking and packing process. Items are barcoded, scanned and visually inspected through all stages. Packaging specifications will be customized and tailored to meet your specific needs. Our large volume of shipments enables us to select the most cost-effective shipping carrier at your desired service level. We validate shipping addresses to make sure orders can be delivered accurately and on-time.
